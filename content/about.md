Hey there! I'm the founder of [Puzzlet.ai](https://www.puzzlet.ai), a git-based GenAI platform!

I'm an Engineer, Founder, and a DevRel advocate. I'm passionate about Software Architecture, Content Management Systems, and LLM Ops. Previously, I've worked at [Hubspot](https://www.hubspot.com) and [Curriculum Associates](https://www.curriculumassociates.com/) in both IC and tech lead roles.

Outside of Puzzlet, I create blog content, and provide consulting for companies building content management systems.
