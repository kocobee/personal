Welcome! I'm the founder of [Puzzlet](https://www.puzzlet.ai), a git-based GenAI platform!

I'm a developer, founder, and developer ralations advocate. I'm passionate about Software Architecture, Content Management Systems, and LLM Ops. Previously, I've worked at [Hubspot](https://www.hubspot.com) and [Curriculum Associates](https://www.curriculumassociates.com/) in both IC and tech lead roles.

Outside of Puzzlet, I create blog content, and provide consulting for companies building content management systems.
